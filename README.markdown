# ZSH Config

I'm an avid proponent of [fish shell](http://fishshell.com), but its lack of
bash-compliance is a deal-breaker.

I've been considering for a while switching to zsh, but I've been spoiled by
fish's awesome features.

I strived to make a zsh config that feels a lot like fish. This repo will
update as I get closer.

## Installation

If you trust me, here's a one-liner. Do not install this without reading the
script first. **Your configuration is backed up to `.zshrc.old`.**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harlanhaskins/harlan-zsh-config.git ~/.harlan-zsh-config; sh ~/.harlan-zsh-config/setup-zshrc.sh;
```
